This is Application in Python Using previous data of rainfall of Kerala  we get to know the pattern in Kerala can be predicted using Multiple Linear Regression. Using rain data of previous 117 years we can get patterns in various graphs like Scatter Plot, Violin Graph, Histogram, etc. Using various graphs we come at a point to use Multiple Linear Regression. We get generate a model which represents relation between months and amount of rainfall, so it is easy to get amount of rainfall for particular value.Multiple Linear Regression also helps to study the pattern of rainfall in Kerala so any changes in previous month data can give signals or indications of irregular rainfall. This can be taken in considerations to take further actions by government and citizens for further planning
