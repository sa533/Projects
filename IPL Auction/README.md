#IPL AUCTIONS

ABOUT PROJECT ::-

The proposed system is most useful and effective for the Biding purposes online, as there is no other online biding mechanism for IPL Auction. The traditional way of auction is, making the team owners of all the teams to gather at one place along with the auctioneer(s) and then start the auction or biding. But by this project, it is not compulsory that all of these people have to gather at one place. Since it is an internet based project, so any team owner can bid on any player no matter what his/her location is. And that is the biggest advantage of this system. Along with the biding process; the team owner can also see all the updates in their respective teamâ€™s money balance whenever he owns the player.This project is follows Clients-Server architecture where auctioneer is server side and other eight teams as clients.
